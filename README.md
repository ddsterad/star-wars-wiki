# Star Wars Wiki

The aim of this project is to build a wiki dedicated to the Star Wars film saga, retrieving data from some APIs and displaying the results in a paginated manner.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npx create-react-app star-wars-wiki --template typescript`


## How to run the application

Before starting, place yourself in the root of the project and ensure that you have correctly installed all the project libraries by running the following command

### `npm install`

Once this operation is completed, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
